And don't forget your towel

Alexander the Great had Aristotle as his tutor, Cosimo II de' Medici had Galileo Galilei as his tutor, I have The Internet and many centuries of knowlegde as my tutor.

This will become my sort of notes and blog website encompassing all of my
interests that I can write about and also serving as a vault where I can store
any good sources of knowledge or good ideas I have *every now and then.*\\
**Now lets sit back enjoy and eat some [juicy gullasch](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tTP1TcwzDI3LTJgdGDw4kgvzclJLE7OAABHzAae&q=gullasch&oq=gullasch&aqs=chrome.1.0i355i512j46i512j0i512l2j46i512j0i10i512l3.4758j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8){:style="color: hotpink; text-decoration: none"}**.

<strong>Meta Todo:</strong>

* Compile list of boiler plate courses on how to **learn everything/anything** and to **build everything/anything**
	* How to hardware
	* How to software

This is why I decided to take up Computer Engineering, to understand and build the world!

Lol not cringe at all

But basically I want to do this cos there are a lot of lists out there but they
are: 
* either not condensed and have too many ways to learn the same thing 
* or are limited by and only cover a subsection of *everything*

A big part of learning everything and anything is learning how to learn.
Learning how to be an autodidact. So I will also have to compile something on
how to be an autodidact

**Insatiable curiosity, galore!!**
