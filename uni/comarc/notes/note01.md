# Descriptive stats

## Population
## Sample
## Attributes

There are two main flavour of data:

1. Quantitative

1. Categorical
    * Discrete data
    * Continuous data

# Categorical Data

## Frequency Tables

### Absolute cumulative fequencies:
$F_i = \sum_{k}^{} a_n z^n$ where $F_k$ is the fequency of category $S_k$

### Relative cumulative fequencies: 
$P_i = \sum_{k} a_n z^n$ where $f_k$ is the fequency of category $S_k$


Categorical data can only can only be plotted in two ways:

1. Pie Charts
1. Bar Charts

# Quantitative Data
