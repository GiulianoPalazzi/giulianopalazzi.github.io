# This is a collection of websites I find cool and useful

They are roughly divided into subcategories

![De tuin der lusten](/assets/images/Jardin.jpg){:style="margin: 0 auto 0 0;width: 90%;"}

### Learning

* <a href="https://www.typing.com/" target="_blank">Typing.com</a> Increase the bandwidth between you and your computer<!--Learn to touch type it is crucial, this is the website I used to learn (learnt it over the pandemic). As Jeff Atwood (one of the founders of stackoverflow) once said "We are typists first, then programmers"-->.
* <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Missing Semester</a> (a bunch of basic stuff put together by some M.I.T. profs)
* <a href="https://commonmark.org/help/" target="_blank">Learn markdown in 10 mins</a> looks like it's not going away or getting changed anytime soon, like txt files, unlike the everchanging glorious MS docx files
* <a href="https://rwxrob.live/" target="_blank">rwxrob personal website</a> Boost/Skilstak has a lot of goodies (specially for tmux, bash, vim, ssh and lynx quick searching)
  * <a href="/resources/rwxrob">RwxRob condensed summary</a>. This is just a list of stuff that I learnt or want to learn from him which I find useful
* <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> One of the best websites for learning anything in general

Many of these things if not all I use for note taking and I regard them as basic knowledge everyone should have

* I haven't tried this one but it is said that it is pretty good: [Learn X in Y minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/qoz9vg/you_found_the_place_that_will_teach_you_how_to/){:target="\_blank"}
* [Make magazine](https://makezine.com/){:target="_blank"}

### Media in general

* <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/" target="_blank">r/piracy</a> on reddit

### Books

* <a href="https://z-lib.org/" target="_blank">Z library</a> Most likely has the book you are looking for (link on this page might not work where you are at so google for you local mirror of this site)\
  **note**: if book limit download reached use a temp mail service
  to make an account and if book <br /> not available in through regular internet
  you might have to use tor protocol to access it
* <a href="https://librivox.org/" target="_blank">Librivox</a> Has a lot of audiobooks but isn't very easy to search (uses torrent protocol for sharing files)
* <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks" target="_blank">Standardebooks</a> Best for old books that are out of copyright and for EPUB books, they have the best text formatting I've seen
* [Biblio](https://www.biblio.com/){:target="\_blank"} a better site than amazon for buying used book
* Ebay for second hand books
* Local second hand book shops
