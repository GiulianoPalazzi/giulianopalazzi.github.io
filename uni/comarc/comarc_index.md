# Exam rules

* The first part accounts up to **24 points**. The following thresholds do apply all together:
    * It is necessary that for the student to respond to at least 2 out of the 4 first part “test-questions”;
    * It is necessary to receive more than 1 point in the first 4 “test-questions”;
    * It is necessary to receive more than 13 points in the overall written exam.

  For if not, there will be a straight rejection (no oral exam). Kindly observe that no corrections will be made by
  Professors to written exams which did not get more than 1 point in the first 4 “test-questions” and/or did not
  respond to at least 2 “test-questions”.

* The oral questions following the program(s) discussion, can decrease by any amount the first part score, or add
up to **9 additional points**. Failure to respond in a sufficient way, can at any time lead to a rejection, which has not
necessarily to be communicated immediately, but in general will follow the general protocol to communicate the
final results through portale della didattica or other similar systems.
