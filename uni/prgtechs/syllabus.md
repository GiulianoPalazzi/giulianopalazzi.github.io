Basic notions of architecture and logic (10 h)
* references to the architecture and functioning of the computer and of the central memory
* the concept of pointer / address
* compilation, link, execution, program organization in memory
* Boolean algebra and logical functions

C as a second programming language (20 h)
* Basic types and I/O:
	* primitive data types (scalars), symbolic constants
	* I/O operations (on stdin/stdout and text files)
* Conditional and iterative constructs
* Functions and parameters passing (by value/reference)
* Aggregated data types:
	* arrays and static matrices (of interegs, float and characters)
	* strings and arrays of strings
	* struct (aggregated types)

Pointers and dynamic allocation in C (10 h)
* pointer as reference to data
* syntactic elements
* array/pointer duality and pointer arithmetic
* dynamic allocation, dynamic arrays and matrices

Elementary problem-solving (20 h)
* analysis of computational complexity
* problem solving:
	* iterative sorting algorithms
	* problems on numbers (mathematical problems and/or algaebric/geometric problems with matrices and arrays)
	* problems of text processing (manipulation of texts, menu selection)
	* problems of numbers/text encoding (es. criptography, compression etc.)
	* problems of verification, selection, sorting.
