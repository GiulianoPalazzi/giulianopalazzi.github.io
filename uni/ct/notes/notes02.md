# Resistors in series #

Two elements are in series if they exclusively share the same node and therefore have the same current flowing through them.

$$R_{eq} =  + R_2 + R_3 + ... + R_n$$

So long as the Resistors are in series

This can be considered a compression and like in any compression nothing is free and we lose some information. In this case, the information we lose is the individual voltages.

# Resistors in parallel #

Two or more elements are in parallel if they are connected to the same nodes and therefore have the same voltage across them.

$$R_{eq} = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + ... + 1/R_n$$

So long as the Resistors are in series

This can be considered a compression and like in any compression nothing is free and we lose some information. In this case, the information we lose is the individual currents.

# Practical application of these rules #

You can create almost any value resistance by combining any number of resistor. Cos as the prof said the shops don't have all the possible resistances.

# Voltage division rule #

With resistors in series the current is a ratio of the resistances over the total resistance for the individual resistance

# Current division rule #

With resistors in series the current is a ratio of the resistances over the total resistance for the individual resistance
