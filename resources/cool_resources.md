They are roughly divided into subcategories

### Learning
* <a href="https://www.typing.com/" target="_blank">Typing.com</a> Increase the bandwidth between you and your computer<!--Learn to touch type it is crucial, this is the website I used to learn (learnt it over the pandemic). As Jeff Atwood (one of the founders of stackoverflow) once said "We are typists first, then programmers"-->.

**note**: if book limit download reached use a temp mail service
to make an account and if book <br />  not available in through regular internet
you might have to use tor protocol to access it
